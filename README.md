# Stock_Screener

Stock screener built using FastAPI and Python. Currently in beta.

To run: Type in terminal: pip3 install -r requirements.txt , then type: uvicorn main:app --reload

This readme file will be updated with more info shortly. 

Current issues: Clicking on "Add stock" does not post data into the database. Only the "GET" request is called.
